3. The face up or face down state of the cards should not change when the user changes the theme.
4. Ensure each of the three themes has a different number of pairs of cards, with a minimum of 4 pairs per theme.
5. Cards should appear in a random order each time a theme button is chosen.
6. Theme-choosing buttons must include an image and text describing the theme, stacked vertically.
